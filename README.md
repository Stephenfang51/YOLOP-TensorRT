# YOLOP-TensorRT
This is unofficial implementation of YOLOP-TensorRT, whereas the official code was no longer supported by author, and there are still bugs haven't been solved, I reconstruct the code and it is easy to use

most of module like bottleneckCSP etc are from **tensorrtx** which is great and useful.
